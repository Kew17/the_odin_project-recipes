        <p>Basundi is a rich, creamy Indian dessert that’s made with milk and flavored with spices and dry fruits. My easy basundi recipe is ready in under 30 minutes thanks to a secret ingredient. I use sweetened condensed milk to prepare this wonderfully indulgent dish in a jiffy! Here you’ll find step-by-step instructions and photos to make the best (and fastest) basundi from scratch.</p>

        <h5>How to prepare?</h5>
        <ol>
            <li> Firstly, take ½ a can of condensed milk (200 grams) or ½ cup + 2 tablespoons in a heavy skillet or thick bottomed saucepan or kadai (wok). </li>
            <li>Add 2 cups of whole milk. Do not use low-fat or skimmed milk. </li>
            <li>With a whisk mix well enough to combine the thick condensed milk with whole milk to get an even liquid. The mixture should be even or else the condensed milk at the bottom can burn while cooking. So make sure there is no condensed milk at the bottom of the pan. All the condensed milk should be mixed with the milk.</li>
            <li>Switch on the heat and keep it to a low.</li>
            <li>Place pan on the stove-top and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes. Stir after intervals of 3 to 4 minutes on low heat. Continue to stir often as you bring the mixture to a gentle boil. Be careful to not let the milk brown on the bottom of the pot.As it cooks, use a rubber spatula or wooden spatula to scrape the sides of the pan and stir the milk solids back into the basundi mixture.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile chop the nuts and set them aside. Add your choice of chopped nuts. My favorite nuts to include are: cashews, pistachios, almonds. </li>
            <li>The basundi mixture will begin to thicken as you continue to cook it. After it simmers for 20 to 25 minutes the basundi should be slightly thick but smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li>Add the slivered nuts.</li>
            <li>Grate nutmeg to get a pinch of it or add a generous pinch of ground nutmeg powder.</li>
            <li>Add ½ teaspoon cardamom powder (4 green cardamom pods, powdered in a mortar-pestle) and 10 to 12 strands of saffron. Also add 2 tablespoons of chironji (charoli seeds). Make sure that the chironji are fresh and not rancid or tasting bitter. As they get rancid very quickly. Chironji is also known as charoli and these small brown seeds give a lovely crunch and a nuttiness to this creamy dessert.</li>
            <li>Stir to mix and simmer the basundi for another minute.</li>
        </ol>
