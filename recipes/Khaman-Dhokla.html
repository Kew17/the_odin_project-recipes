        <p>Khaman, also known as khaman dhokla in other Indian states, is a popular delicacy from the Gujarati cuisine. It is light, spongy and includes a hint of great savory flavor from a simple combination of gram flour (besan), spices, and herbs. Gram flour is ground skinned black chickpeas.Khaman is a healthy savory-sweet snack that happens to be vegan. Plus, it can be gluten-free too, if you skip semolina and asafoetida in the batter. Khaman is also known as yellow dhokla as it has a yellow color or besan dhokla. It is also known as instant khaman. I prepare khaman dhokla with the steaming method either in an Instant pot or in a pan. They’re perfect to enjoy for a hearty and satisfying breakfast or an afternoon or evening snack.</p>

        <h5>How to prepare?</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Grease a steamer pan with 2 to 3 teaspoons oil.</li>
            <li>Take 1.5 cups gram flour (120 grams besan) in a mixing bowl or pan. Do use gram flour which has a fine texture. </li>
            <li>
                <p>The add the following ingredients:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 to 3 pinches of turmeric powder</li>
                    <li>a generous pinch of asafoetida (skip to make a gluten-free version)</li>
                    <li>1.5 tablespoons lemon or lime juice or ⅓ to ½ teaspoon pure citric acid </li>
                    <li>1.5 teaspoons ginger paste (crush 1.5 inch ginger and 1.5 teaspoons green chilies in a mortar-pestle)</li>
                    <li>1.5 teaspoons green chili paste</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon sugar or add according to taste</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon salt or add as per taste </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Add 1 cup water (or more or less as needed) and 1 tablespoon oil to make a thick yet smooth flowing batter. The amount of water needed depends on the quality of flour, so start with 1 cup and add as required. Stir well to combine.</li>
            <li>Then add 1 tablespoon rava (semolina). This is entirely optional but adds a good texture to the khaman. Skip rava or semolina for a gluten-free option.</li>
            <li>Stir with a whisk to create a smooth, thick batter without any lumps.</li>
            <li>The batter should be thick yet flow easily off of the whisk. A quick tip is that if the batter becomes thin, then 1 to 2 tablespoons of gram flour.Next bring 2 to 2.5 cups of water to a boil in a steamer pan or electric cooker or pressure cooker. The amount of water to be added depends on the size of the steamer or pressure cooker. </li>
            <li>Next add 2 teaspoons Eno or fruit salt. 2 teaspoons of Eno makes the khaman soft and fluffy. But there is a slightly alkaline taste to Eno. If you’re not a fan of this flavor then add only 1.5 teaspoons of Eno. If using baking soda as your leavening agent add ½ teaspoon to ¾ teaspoon.</li>
            <li>Stir the eno with the batter briskly and quickly.</li>
            <li>The fruit salt should be mixed evenly with the batter. Or else you get uneven texture in the khaman.</li>
            <li>The eno will make the batter become frothy, so you need to work quickly to whisk it in thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Pour the prepared batter into the greased pan.</li>
            <li>Gently shake so that the batter evens out in the pan. Below is a picture of the batter ready to be steamed.</li>
            <li>Place the pan in a steamer or electric rice cooker or pressure cooker. The water should already be boiling or hot when you place the pan with the khaman batter. When using a pressure cooker, remove the vent weight/whistle from the lid and cover the cooker tightly with its lid. </li>
            <li>Steam for 15 to 20 minutes in an electric rice cooker. If using a pan or pressure cooker or Instant Pot, steam for 12 to 15 minutes on a medium to medium-high heat. In the below photo the khaman is cooked for 17 minutes using an electric rice cooker. You can begin working on the spice and herb solution for tempering the khaman while it cooks. Continue reading for the instructions.</li>
            <li>To check the doneness, insert a toothpick. It should come out clean if the khaman is done. If the toothpick has the batter on it, then you need to steam for another minutes or so.</li>
            <li>Let the khaman become warm or cool completely. Gently slide a butter knife along the edges to release the khaman from the pan. Place a plate or tray on top of the pan.</li>
            <li>Use a sharp knife to slice the khaman in squares and set aside until ready to temper. Since I used a concave plate, the khaman settled down in the center. This won’t happen if you use a flat plate.</li>
        </ol>
