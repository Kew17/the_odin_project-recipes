        <h5>How to prepare?</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Take all the ingredients for the gram flour batter in a mixing bowl. This includes all the spice powders, ginger-green chili paste, gram flour and salt.</li>
            <li>Add the powdered jaggery and tamarind pulp.</li>
            <li>Stir well and make a very thick batter or paste. Keep aside.</li>
            <li>Rinse and dry the leaves with a kitchen napkin.</li>
            <li>Slice the stalk from the base of the leaf.</li>
            <li>Place the leaf with the veins facing you and slice the middle vein right through the center, taking care not to break the leaf. Remove any other thick veins from the sides too. Keep all the leaves ready like this. instead of using knife (as it might tear the leaf if not used properly) you can also use a belan ( i.e a rolling pin) and gently roll it on the leaves. This will flatten the veins and leaf will not get cut. You can adjust the pressure as per the thickness of the vein.</li>
            <li>Place the leaf with the vein sides facing downwards and the tip facing you. Apply the besan paste. Before beginning to roll, sort the leaves and place the largest one at the bottom and continue to keep the medium and smaller ones as you stack them up.</li>
            <li>Now place another leaf with the tip in the opposite direction. Placing the leaves in the opposite direction helps them to roll easily.</li>
            <li>Apply the besan paste on the second leaf.</li>
            <li>Completely cover the leaf with the gram flour paste.</li>
            <li>Now place a third leaf with the tip facing youâ€¦ and apply the paste on this leaf too.</li>
            <li>Apply the besan paste to the folded side and fold from the opposite side also. Apply besan paste to this second folded side too.</li>
            <li>Begin to tightly roll the leaves and keep on apply the besan paste with each fold on the top.</li>
            <li>Almost finished rolling the stack of leaves.</li>
            <li>I made two rolls from two batches of 20 leaves. Each roll had 10 leaves. Place these rolls in a greased steamer pan. Steam for 20-25 minutes in a steamer or pressure cooker without the vent weight or whistle.</li>
            <li>The leaves and the besan paste would be completely cooked and the rolls would hold shape and become firm after cooking.</li>
            <li>When warm or cooled, slice the rolls into 1/2 inch thickness.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a pan or kadai. Add the tempering ingredients and fry for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the sliced colocasia rolls and saute in the oil on a low flame for few minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve the alu vadi or patra hot or warm. you can also garnish the alu vadi with coconut and coriander instead of mixing them with the rolls.</li>
